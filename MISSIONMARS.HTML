           <CENTER> <h1>MISSIONS MARS</h1></CENTER>
           NASA has had several missions to Mars, aiming to explore the Red Planet and gather data about its environment, climate, geology, and potential for past or present life. Some of the most notable missions to Mars include:

<H3>1. Mariner Missions (1960s-1970s)</H3>
Mariner 4 (1964): The first successful mission to Mars, it sent back the first close-up images of the Martian surface.
Mariner 6 and 7 (1969): These spacecraft also provided valuable data about Mars, including the discovery of a heavily cratered surface.
<H3>2. Viking Program (1970s)</H3>
Viking 1 and 2 (1976): These were the first successful landers on Mars. They conducted experiments to search for signs of life and sent back detailed images and data on the surface.
<H3>3. Mars Pathfinder (1997)</H3>
Sojourner Rover: Part of the Mars Pathfinder mission, the Sojourner rover was the first successful rover to operate on the surface of Mars. It explored rocks and soil and sent back valuable images and data.
<H3>4. Mars Odyssey (2001)</H3>
This orbiter has been continuously studying Mars from orbit since 2001, mapping the planet’s surface, studying its climate, and acting as a relay station for other Mars missions. It discovered signs of water ice beneath the surface.
<H3>5. Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) - 2004</H3>
Spirit and Opportunity: These twin rovers were designed to search for evidence of past water on Mars. Spirit explored the Gusev Crater, while Opportunity explored the Meridiani Planum region. Both made groundbreaking discoveries, including evidence of ancient water flows. Opportunity operated for nearly 15 years, far exceeding its expected mission duration.
<H3>6. Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity Rover) - 2012</H3>
Curiosity: A car-sized rover designed to explore Gale Crater on Mars. It has been studying the planet’s habitability, climate, and geology. One of its key findings was evidence of ancient water in the form of dried-up riverbeds.
<H3>7. InSight Mission (2018)</H3>
The InSight lander was designed to study the interior of Mars. It uses a seismometer to detect "marsquakes," providing insights into the planet's internal structure. InSight also deployed a heat probe to measure the planet's temperature beneath its surface.
<H3>8. Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity Helicopter (2021)</H3>
Perseverance: Launched in 2020 and landing on Mars in February 2021, the Perseverance rover is tasked with searching for signs of ancient life, collecting soil and rock samples for future return missions, and testing new technologies for future human exploration.
Ingenuity: A small helicopter carried by Perseverance, Ingenuity made its first flight on Mars in April 2021, becoming the first powered flight on another planet. It has since performed numerous successful flights, helping to scout terrain for Perseverance.
<H3>9. Mars Sample Return Mission (Future)</H3>
NASA is working on a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA) for the Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. This ambitious mission aims to bring samples of Martian soil and rocks back to Earth for analysis, potentially unlocking key answers about the planet’s history and its potential for life.
Future Plans:
NASA has several planned and conceptual missions for the exploration of Mars, including:

Human Missions to Mars: NASA is aiming to send humans to Mars in the 2030s as part of its long-term exploration goals. This is part of the broader Artemis program to return humans to the Moon and eventually establish a sustainable presence there.
Mars Arctic Research Station: Simulated Mars missions, like the Mars Arctic Research Station in the Canadian Arctic, are used to study the effects of isolation and long-duration missions to prepare for human exploration of Mars.
