           <p>The Parker Solar Probe is a NASA spacecraft designed to study the Sun up close, launched on August 12, 2018. It is one of the most ambitious space missions, aiming to answer critical questions about solar activity, solar wind, and the Sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona.

            Here are some key facts about the Parker Solar Probe:
            
            <h2>Mission Objectives:</h2>
           <h4> Understanding the Sun’s corona:</h4> The Parker Solar Probe will get closer to the Sun than any previous spacecraft, studying the corona, the Sun's outer atmosphere. It aims to explain why the corona is hotter than the Sun's surface (photosphere), which is a longstanding mystery in solar physics.
            
           <h4> Exploring solar wind:</h4> The spacecraft will help scientists learn more about the origins and acceleration of the solar wind, which affects space weather and can disrupt communication and navigation systems on Earth.
            
            <h4>Magnetic Fields:</h4> The probe will measure the Sun’s magnetic fields to understand how they influence solar phenomena like solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
            
           <h2> Key Features:</h2>
            <h4>Closest Approach:</h4> The Parker Solar Probe is designed to get as close as 4 million miles from the Sun's surface, which is about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft, including NASA’s Helios probes.
            
           <h4> Speed:</h4> It is the fastest man-made object ever created, reaching speeds up to 430,000 miles per hour (700,000 km/h) as it orbits the Sun.
            
           <h4> Heat Protection:</h4> The spacecraft is equipped with a solar shield made of carbon-composite material, which protects its instruments from temperatures exceeding 2,500°F (1,377°C). The heat shield is crucial for preventing damage to the instruments.
            
            <h2>Instruments on Board:</h2>
            <h4>FIELDS:</h4> Measures the electric and magnetic fields in the Sun’s atmosphere.
            <h4>WISPR:</h4> The Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe, which captures images of the solar corona and solar wind.
            <h4>SWEAP:</h4> Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons, which measures the properties of particles in the solar wind.
            <h4>ISʘIS: </h4>Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, which measures high-energy solar particles.
            <h2>Importance of the Mission:</h2>
            By studying the Sun more closely than ever before, the Parker Solar Probe hopes to improve our understanding of solar processes that affect both our planet and the broader solar system. It will help scientists predict space weather, which can have significant effects on satellite communications, GPS systems, and power grids on Earth.
            
           <h2> Milestones:</h2>
            <h4>First Close Approach:</h4> In November 2018, Parker made its first close approach to the Sun, coming within 26.5 million miles (42.7 million km) of the Sun’s surface, providing early data on the solar wind and corona.
            
           <h4> Ongoing Mission: </h4>The spacecraft's orbit brings it closer to the Sun over a series of seven flybys, with its closest approach scheduled for 2024.
            
            The Parker Solar Probe is a groundbreaking mission that will transform our understanding of the Sun and its impact on space weather, potentially leading to advances in protecting our technology from solar disruptions.</p>
